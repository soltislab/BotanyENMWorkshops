It is native to the southeastern United States from Massachusetts and New York south to northern Alabama, growing mainly in the Appalachian Mountains at altitudes of up to 1,500 m, where it grows in shaded places in forests. (Source: Wikipedia, Galax, CC BY-SA 3.0)"" https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/galax-urceolata/ Galax is a North Carolina native that exhibits shiny, long-stalked, roundish heart-shaped leaves, 2-5 in. wide. It is a perennial with bright green leaves in summer that become bronzed to reddish in winter. Small white feathery flowers arranged in a narrow cluster on a naked stalk rise above the leaves in late spring or early summer. The flower stalks are 8-15 inches high. Galax prefers cool, moist sites with partial shade. It is common to the NC mountains and Piedmont, but unusual in the coastal areas. It grows in slow expanding clumps and its flowers attract bees.
